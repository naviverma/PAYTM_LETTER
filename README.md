# PAYTM_LETTER

I have gained an internship experience with Paytm, India's largest Payment company this summer. During that internship, I did two full-stack training projects
in which I worked with third party REST APIs, UI/UX, front end and layouts. Along with that I also learnt the integration of Google Ads, Firebase Analytics, and
other applications into the project. I worked closely with my team using the technologies like JIRA, Google Meet, Bitbucket and GitHub etc. Through the internship
I focused on MVC Architecture, Test Driven Development and wrote Test Cases for the codebase. I learnt the principle of Code reusability which helped me to write better
production code.

PayTM | Software Engineer Internship | 2023 Summer
• Completed two training projects in order to learn third party API handling, Code Reusability, MVP, Code testing, 
Code Architecture, Advanced App Layouts and understanding full development Life cycle.
